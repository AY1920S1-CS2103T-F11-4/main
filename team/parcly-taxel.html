<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the CS2103 Software Engineering module at the National University of Singapore,
I was part of a team of five tasked to develop an application from <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">a given Java
address book application</a>, which will be called AB3 in the rest of the portfolio.
We chose to morph it into NUStudy, an application for
managing lecture notes, questions and revision tasks&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all three things pertinent to the
average university student, regardless of location. Like the original, it has a command line
as its main method of interaction and a JavaFX GUI for display. It has around 5000 lines of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This portfolio showcases my contributions to NUStudy: implementing the lecture notes by
retooling the existing <em>Person</em> class, related documentation in the user and developer guides
and management of the Git repository surrounding NUStudy. It also showcases my technical writing skills
and my ability to explain complicated enhancements or modifications to the uninitiated person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this portfolio <code>monospace</code> indicates command-line input (commands, parameters, etc.)
and <em>italics</em> mark class names. Pull requests and issues will be marked solely
by their numbers and a # sign (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/issues/1">#1</a>);
unless otherwise specified they refer to NUStudy.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a brief description of my contributions to NUStudy – to code, documentation
and project management. These contributions show my ability to not only write good code,
but also manage and synthesise team members' varying output into a coherent whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was responsible for <strong>implementing lecture notes</strong> (starting from <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/34">#34</a>).
These are simple items with a title, some content and optionally an image. For this I modified the existing
<em>Person</em> class in the original address book application and its associated commands (<em>AddCommand</em>, <em>EditCommand</em>, etc.)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I did not have to make any new classes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecture notes are the primary source of a student&#8217;s acquired knowledge in university, yet they come in many formats.
Having a unified appearance helps the student understand the content of lecture notes better, by removing
unnecessary markup and distracting styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While adding this feature I also refactored all other code throughout the application to use names relevant to
lecture notes. This helped my teammates add their own features, setting an example for them to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image support was implemented starting from <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/67">#67</a>. Instead of a custom class,
I used JavaFX&#8217;s <em>scene.image.Image</em>, which reduced the additional code I had to write on top of the
<em>Title</em> and <em>Content</em> classes by avoiding an unnecessary wrapper.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>As my fellow team members added their features to the code, one of the constructors of <em>CommandResult</em>
grew to have four boolean variables representing command side effects. In <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/71">#71</a>
I replaced the boolean arguments of this constructor with a single integer argument acting as a bit field.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This serves two purposes: to avoid unnecessary use of the boolean literals and to allow easy extension
to more side effects by increasing the range of the integer argument.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>I enforced a style for the user and developer guides and wrote several of their key sections,
such as the user guide&#8217;s introduction and the developer guide&#8217;s non-functional requirements.
See <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/21">#21</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/22">#22</a>
for examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was the <strong>lead integrator</strong> for NUStudy:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managed all four releases (v1.1 to v1.4) on GitHub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up Travis and Netlify for the project, enabling continuous integration and previews of documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolved merge conflicts for teammates' pull requests (see <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/44">#44</a> for an example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attached milestones and labels to issues and pull requests where the original authors failed to specify them</p>

<p>Our application&#8217;s user guide had to be updated with the new features we added in code.
The sections below are what I wrote for my features, demonstrating my ability to write
clear, concise end-user documentation.</p>

<h4 id="adding-lecture-notes-code-addnote-code"><a class="link" href="#adding-lecture-notes-code-addnote-code">Adding lecture notes: <code>addnote</code></a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the basic command for getting your lecture notes into NUStudy. The <code>i/</code> field, if provided, brings up a
dialog where you can choose an image from your computer&#8217;s file system; such an image will be displayed at the
bottom of the note.<br>
Format: <code>addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you want to remember what the order-7 triangular tiling looks like and its Schläfli symbol.
Type <code>addnote t/Order-7 triangular tiling c/{3,7} i/</code> into the command line. The file selection dialog
will pop up, and you can select the image from your file system. Once done, you will see the lecture note:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/screenshots/addnote.png" alt="addnote">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your images are copied into the local application data folder of NUStudy, so don&#8217;t worry about losing track of
your images – you can always take them along with the application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="editing-lecture-notes-code-editnote-code"><a class="link" href="#editing-lecture-notes-code-editnote-code">Editing lecture notes: <code>editnote</code></a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your lecture notes need updating, use this command, providing arguments <code>t/</code>, <code>c/</code> and <code>i/</code> (at least one)
as you would do with <code>addnote</code>, but only those arguments you want to change. Providing <code>i/</code> brings up the same image
selection dialog like in <code>addnote</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Images can explain a lot, but if you want to remove them, use <code>i/none</code> in your command, and the dialog
will not appear. Otherwise, if you back off from choosing an image (e.g. by clicking the dialog&#8217;s
close button), nothing will happen and your images will remain safe and sound.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple notes can share the same image, and you can overwrite existing images currently
in NUStudy with new ones sharing the same filename.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The index must be between 1 and the number of lecture notes inclusive. It is listed before the title of
each lecture note:</p>

<p>Of course, what use are virtual lecture notes if you can&#8217;t search through them? This command
displays those notes whose titles contain every word (space-separated, ignoring case) you provide
as arguments.<br>
Format: <code>findnote WORD [WORD]…</code></p>

<h2 id="developer-guide-contributions"><a class="link" href="#developer-guide-contributions">Developer guide contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like other projects in CS2103, there is the expectation that future developers could
build on NUStudy. Thus we also updated the developer guide; below are my principal contributions to it,
showcasing three aspects: my ability to write technical documentation, the complexity of what
I contributed in code and my proficiency in using diagrams to explain my work.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="image-support-for-lecture-notes"><a class="link" href="#image-support-for-lecture-notes">Image support for lecture notes</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, we do not learn best from just text; we rely on images that our minds can process more easily.
As such, implementing images in lecture notes was considered very important. Although some lecture notes
have multiple images, it is always possible to combine them using basic image editing software like the
GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and Paint, so the implementation was limited to at most image per note.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of a custom class to represent an image, JavaFX&#8217;s <code>scene.image.Image</code> is used instead.
This is out of necessity, since an <code>ImageView</code> is needed to display an image in the GUI and it requires
an <code>Image</code> object, not just a <code>String</code> path to the image. No significant coupling is introduced
by this choice because <code>Image</code> objects can exist without a GUI to display them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dialog brought up to let the user choose a file returns <code>null</code> if the dialog is closed
<em>without</em> choosing a file (i.e. clicking the close button). Treating <code>null</code> as "no image" would surprise the user who
decides to edit a lecture note&#8217;s image but then decides not to – the image would simply disappear without
warning. Therefore the value <code>i/none</code> has to be explicitly provided to remove the image, and <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code>
has an additional field <code>isImageRemoved</code> to track this. If the image comes out as <code>null</code> but <code>i/none</code> was
not provided, the image is unchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The static method <code>selectImage()</code> in <code>AppUtil</code> opens up a dialog allowing the user to choose the necessary image.
This is possible because <code>FileChooser#showOpenDialog()</code>, which shows the dialog, can be fed an argument of <code>null</code>
instead of having to rely on a <code>Window</code> object, which is the domain of the <code>UI</code> module.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ImageSelectionSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ImageSelectionSequenceDiagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Sequence diagram for the execution of <code>EditNoteCommandParser</code></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram above shows how <code>EditNoteCommandParser</code> creates an <code>EditNoteCommand</code>. It first
creates an <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code> to hold details of what changes in the note, setting the new
title (provided by the <code>t/</code> argument) and content (<code>c/</code>) as necessary. If <code>i/none</code> is present,
the <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code> is set to remove the image and no dialog is shown. If <code>i/</code> is
otherwise provided, <code>EditNoteCommandParser</code> calls the static method <code>AppUtil#selectImage()</code>,
opening up the image selection dialog; the returned <code>Image</code> object is then set in the <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code>.
An <code>EditNoteCommand</code> containing the <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code> is finally returned for execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Images are only referenced, not embedded, in the JSON file holding application data. These references are
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of system files, e.g. <code>file:data/picture.png</code>. Since NUStudy is meant to be portable,
we cannot use absolute paths, since they would break when the images are moved or deleted. Instead we copy images
into its data folder, side-by-side with the JSON file, upon execution of any <code>addnote</code> or <code>editnote</code> command with
an image. The references are then changed to point to these local copies, becoming relative URIs.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both the use of a JavaFX built-in object for images and the system-dependent implementation of
graphics-related objects required me to make certain critical decisions on the implementation of image support.</p>

<ul>

<p><em>Alternative 1 (current choice):</em> Images are shown within each lecture note in the first column, and each lecture note
shows all of its title, content and image</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement (FXML does not have to reach into other places)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Scrolling through lecture notes, all with images, takes time, but this downside is alleviated
by the <code>findnote</code> command</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Alternative 2:</em> Place the images in the second column, below their corresponding title and content</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: More visually appealing, since by keeping just one note in the second column it becomes a kind of flash card</p>

<p>Cons: Harder to implement (FXML must reach into the object representing the second column),
need to have a separate <code>NotePreview</code> JavaFX object since images are only going to be displayed
