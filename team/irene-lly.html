<p>This portfolio documents my contributions to NUStudy, a learning application.
Our team of 5 software engineering students were tasked with
enhancing a basic command line interface desktop Addressbook application
as part of our Software Engineering project in CS2103T.
We were asked to conceptualize and implement enhancements to the existing application
and do it in a manner such that future developers can continue working on it.
After some deliberation, we decided to morph it into an application to facilitate learning for students.
The morphed application, NUStudy, enables students to add and manage notes;
test their knowledge with questions that they have added;
get statistics of how well they have answered these questions;
and set tasks to plan their revision schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I contributed to this project by implementing the statistics feature as documented below.
In particular, I have implemented the <code>stats</code>, <code>questions</code>, <code>report</code> and <code>overview</code> commands.
The following sections illustrate the enhancements in more detail,
as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in
relation to these enhancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:<br>
<code>stats</code>: A grey highlight indicates that this is a command that can be inputted
into the command line and executed by the application.<br>
<strong>Bold</strong>: A bolded word indicates an action to be taken by the user.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows the enhancements I have added to the project as well as my other contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I added the ability to get statistics of the questions done in the quizzes.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The different commands allow users to filter the quiz results
and return an overview of how well they have done the questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: The <code>questions</code> and <code>report</code> commands help users to get an
idea of what subjects they are weaker in and see the common mistakes that they have made.
The <code>stats</code> and <code>overview</code> commands gives users an idea of which questions they
should attempt more of and what subjects they have been neglecting.
Overall, the purpose of the statistics feature is to provide users with a rough
outline of their progress in mastering the foundations of the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives is required in the future.
The implementation was also challenging as it required changes to existing models
and logic classes.</p>

</ul>

<p>We have modified the existing Addressbook User Guide to include commands for the enhancements
that we have added as well as remove the old commands that are not relevant to our project.
The following is an excerpt from our User Guide,

<h3 id="get-statistics"><a class="link" href="#get-statistics">Get statistics</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can get statistics of the questions that you have done in the app.
The statistics functions listed below are used to filter the type of statistics that you want to get.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Quiz results stored in the app are not synchronised with the questions.
If a question has been modified by the editq command,
the stored quiz result will still refer to the original question
to minimise inconsistencies in the statistics. This is because a question that has been modified to a large extent
might cause past answers to become irrelevant and distort the statistics.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statistics feature gathers data stored from quizzes done in NUStudy to analyse and return an output.
The different commands supported by the statistics feature are used to filter the type of statistics the user wants.
These commands include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>GetQnsCommand</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Gets all questions answered correctly/incorrectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>GetReportCommand</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns a report of the specified question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>GetStatisticsCommand</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns a general overview of how well the user has answered quiz questions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application.
The app will attempt to read past data from any quizzes done and store it internally to a <code>quizResults</code> list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user executes <code>stats s/CS2103T</code> command to get the statistics of all quiz questions done for CS2103T.
The <code>stats</code> command creates a new <code>commandResult</code> setting the type of command to <code>CHART</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following class diagram shows how the <code>GetStatisticsCommand</code> and <code>CommandResult</code> class are related.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/StatisticsClassDiagram.png" alt="StatisticsClassDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The <code>commandResult</code> will call the relevant methods to filter the <code>quizResults</code> list and create the relevant outputs.
It will then show a statistics panel, hiding all notes and tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the statistics operation works:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/StatisticsSequenceDiagram.png" alt="StatisticsSequenceDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The user now decides to stop viewing statistics and decides to view all notes and tasks again using the <code>listnote</code> command.
The statistics panel will now be hidden.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the statistics command:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Hide all other panels and only show statistics.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Less scrolling needed, more information can be shown in one panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: More methods are needed to deal with hiding and showing the different panels leading to more room for errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Place statistics in the main window with notes and tasks.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: The number of notes and tasks that can be seen without scrolling will be decreased.
The charts will be small and condensed making it difficult to see the data at first glance.</p>
