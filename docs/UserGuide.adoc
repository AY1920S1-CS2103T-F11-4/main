== Introduction

NUStudy is an application for managing two kinds of informational material:
lecture notes and flash cards. Their primary purpose is preparing for exams
and tests in universities, but they can also be useful for refreshing memory,
particularly after a module has ended (the reliance of some computing modules
on prior knowledge is rather heavy).

Most of the work is done through a command line; the GUI merely displays
the results. The overall appearance is similar to a simple note-taking client.

== Quickstart

.  Ensure you have Java 11+ installed.
.  Download the latest `nustudy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. Some commands you can try are
* `listnote`: lists all lecture notes
* `addnote t/Title c/Content`: adds a lecture note with title "Title" and content "Content".
* `deletenote 1`: deletes the first lecture note
* `help`: open the help window
* `exit`: exits the app

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPERCASE` are parameters you supply e.g. in `addnote t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter
which can be used as `addnote t/TITLE`. Parameters can be provided in any order.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.

=== Lecture notes

==== Adding lecture notes: `addnote`
This is the basic command for getting your lecture notes into NUStudy. The `i/` field, if provided, brings up a
dialog where you can choose an image from your computer's file system; such an image will be displayed at the
bottom of the note. +
Format: `addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]`

Suppose you want to remember what the order-7 triangular tiling looks like and its Schläfli symbol.
Type `addnote t/Order-7 triangular tiling c/{3,7} i/` into the command line. The file selection dialog
will pop up, and you can select the image from your file system. Once done, you will see the lecture note:

image::screenshots/addnote.png[]

Your images are copied into the local application data folder of NUStudy, so don't worry about losing track of
your images – you can always take them along with the application.

==== Editing lecture notes: `editnote`
If your lecture notes need updating, use this command, providing arguments `t/`, `c/` and `i/` (at least one)
as you would do with `addnote`, but only those arguments you want to change. Providing `i/` brings up the same image
selection dialog like in `addnote`.

Images can explain a lot, but if you want to remove them, use `i/none` in your command, and the dialog
will not appear. Otherwise, if you back off from choosing an image (e.g. by clicking the dialog's
close button), nothing will happen and your images will remain safe and sound.

Multiple notes can share the same image, and you can overwrite existing images currently
in NUStudy with new ones sharing the same filename.

The index must be between 1 and the number of lecture notes inclusive. It is listed before the title of
each lecture note:

image::screenshots/index.png[]

Format: `editnote INDEX [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [i/[none]]`

==== Viewing lecture notes: `findnote`
Of course, what use are virtual lecture notes if you can't search through them? This command
displays those notes whose titles contain every word (space-separated, ignoring case) you provide
as arguments. +
Format: `findnote WORD [WORD]…`

==== Listing all lecture notes: `listnote`
This is like running `findnote` but with no arguments. It shows all your lecture notes in their unabashed glory. +
Format: `listnote`

==== Deleting lecture notes: `deletenote`
When your semester ends, surely you want to free up space on your computer so you can accept new notes
for the coming semester? This command deletes the lecture note with the index you provide. +
Format: `deletenote INDEX`

==== Clearing all lecture notes: `clearnote`
Finally, if you ever find a better application than NUStudy for your lecture notes, you can clear
them all. Your quiz questions and revision tasks will not be affected. +
Format: `clearnote`
// end::lecnote[]

at your command, the system will prompt you to answer those questions.
