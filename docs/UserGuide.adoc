== Introduction

NUStudy is an application for managing two kinds of informational material:
lecture notes and flash cards. Their primary purpose is preparing for exams
and tests in universities, but they can also be useful for refreshing memory,
particularly after a module has ended (the reliance of some computing modules
on prior knowledge is rather heavy).

Most of the work is done through a command line; the GUI merely displays
the results. The overall appearance is similar to a simple note-taking client.

== Quickstart

.  Ensure you have Java 11+ installed.
.  Download the latest `nustudy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list`: lists all contacts
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* `delete 3`: deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* `exit`: exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
