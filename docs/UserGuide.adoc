== Introduction

NUStudy is an application for managing three kinds of informational material:
lecture notes, quizzes and revision tasks. Their primary purpose is preparing for exams
and tests in universities, but they can also be useful for refreshing memory,
particularly after a module has ended (the reliance of some computing modules
on prior knowledge is rather heavy).

Most of the work is done through a command line; the GUI merely displays
the results. The overall appearance is similar to a simple note-taking client.

== Quickstart

.  Ensure you have Java 11+ installed.
.  Download the latest `nustudy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the application's home folder.
.  Double-click the file to start the app (if this does not work, use `java -jar nustudy.jar`).
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. Some commands you can try are
* `listnote`: lists all lecture notes
* `addnote t/Title c/Content`: adds a lecture note with title "Title" and content "Content".
* `deletenote 1`: deletes the first lecture note
* `help`: open the help window
* `exit`: exits the app

[[Features]]
== Features

This section helps you navigate through the features and commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPERCASE` are parameters you supply e.g. in `addnote t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter
which can be used as `addnote t/TITLE`. Parameters can be provided in any order; in the case of
multiple parameters with the same prefix (e.g. `addnote t/A t/B`) the last one is taken (`B`)
unless otherwise stated.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.

=== Lecture notes

==== Adding lecture notes: `addnote`
This is the basic command for getting your lecture notes into NUStudy. The `i/` field, if provided, brings up a
dialog where you can choose an image from your computer's file system; such an image will be displayed at the
bottom of the note. +
Format: `addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]`

Suppose you want to remember what the order-7 triangular tiling looks like and its Schläfli symbol.
Type `addnote t/Order-7 triangular tiling c/{3,7} i/` into the command line. The file selection dialog
will pop up, and you can select the image from your file system. Once done, you will see the lecture note:

image::screenshots/addnote.png[]

It is fine to back out of the image selection dialog; an image can always be added later using `editnote`.
Your images are copied into the application's data folder, so don't worry about losing them –
you can always take them along. Images resize according to the window, but if an image is small enough that it can fit at its
natural resolution, it is left that way.

==== Editing lecture notes: `editnote`
If your lecture notes need updating, use this command, providing arguments `t/`, `c/` and `i/` (at least one)
as you would do with `addnote`, but only those arguments you want to change. Providing `i/` brings up the same image
selection dialog like in `addnote`.

Images can explain a lot, but if you want to remove them, use `i/none` in your command, and the dialog
will not appear. Otherwise, if you back off from choosing an image (e.g. by clicking the dialog's
close button), nothing will happen and your images will remain safe and sound.

Multiple notes can share the same image, and you can overwrite existing images currently
in NUStudy with new ones sharing the same filename.

The index must be between 1 and the number of lecture notes inclusive. It is listed before the title of
each lecture note:

image::screenshots/index.png[]

Format: `editnote INDEX [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [i/[none]]`

==== Viewing lecture notes: `findnote`
Of course, what use are virtual lecture notes if you can't search through them? This command
displays those notes whose titles contain any one of the words (space-separated, ignoring case) you provide
as arguments. +
Format: `findnote WORD [WORD]…`

==== Listing all lecture notes: `listnote`
This is like running `findnote` but with no arguments. It shows all your lecture notes in their unabashed glory. +
Format: `listnote`

==== Deleting lecture notes: `deletenote`
When your semester ends, surely you want to free up space on your computer so you can accept new notes
for the coming semester? This command deletes the lecture note with the index you provide. +
Format: `deletenote INDEX`

==== Clearing all lecture notes: `clearnote`
Finally, if you ever find a better application than NUStudy for your lecture notes, you can clear
them all. Your quiz questions and revision tasks will not be affected. +
Format: `clearnote`
// end::lecnote[]

// tag::question[]
=== Questions

NUStudy can also store different sets of questions and answers;
at your command, the system will prompt you to answer those questions.

==== Adding Questions : `addq`

You can add a question and its answer together with the necessary fields to the app. +
Format: `addq q/QUESTION a/ANSWER s/SUBJECT d/DIFFICULTY`

****
* You can define any type of difficulty level that is customized to your understanding of the question.
****

Example:

image::questionCommandsDemo/listqresult.png[width = "600"]

==== Editing a question: `editq`

You can edit the fields of an existing question by providing the fields you want to change. +
Format: `editq INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER] [d/DIFFICULTY] [s/SUBJECT]`

****
* Edits the question at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed
question list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `editq 7 a/16 d/easy`

image::questionCommandsDemo/editqcommand.png[width = "600"]

Edits the answer and difficulty of the 2nd question to be `16` and `easy` respectively.

image::questionCommandsDemo/editqresult.png[width = "600"]

==== Locating questions by keyword: `findq`

This command will give you a list of questions whose body or answer contains the keyword(s) you specified. +
Format: `findq KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive.
* The order of the keywords does not matter.
* Only full words will be matched.
****

Examples:

* `findq UDP`

image::questionCommandsDemo/findqcommand.png[width = "600"]

Finds the question whose body contains the keyword `UDP`.

image::questionCommandsDemo/findqresult.png[width = "600"]


==== Deleting a question: `deleteq`

You can delete a question at its specified INDEX together with its relevant fields from the list. +
Format: `deleteq INDEX`

****
* Deletes the question at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed question list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Example:

* `listq` +
`deleteq 3`

image::questionCommandsDemo/deleteqcommand.png[width = "600"]

Deletes the 2nd question from the question list.

* `findq character` +
`deleteq 1`

Deletes the 1st question in the results of `findq` command.

==== Filter by difficulty: `difficulty`

You can view the list of all questions filtered by the specific difficulty. +
Format: `difficulty DIFFICULTY`

****
* The search is case insensitive.
* Only full difficulty will be matched.
****

Example:

* `difficulty hard`

image::questionCommandsDemo/difficultycommand.png[width = "600"]

Returns a list of `hard` questions.

You can delete all questions from the app. +
Format: `clearq`

image::questionCommandsDemo/clearcommand.png[width = "600"]

image::questionCommandsDemo/clearresult.png[width = "600"]
// end::question[]

// tag::quizStart[]
=== Quiz mode

There is a built-in quiz mode in NUStudy for you to take a revision quiz. You can indicate the number of questions,
subject and difficulty and the quiz will randomly select questions for you according to your requirement. You will
answer the question one by one and your result will be given.

==== Enter quiz mode : `quiz`

You can enter the quiz mode using this command. +
Format: `quiz n/NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS d/DIFFICULTY s/SUBJECT`

NOTE: The `NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS` must be a positive integer. +
`DIFFICULTY` and `SUBJECT` are case insensitive.

_**Example:**_

Step 1: Types `quiz n/2 d/Easy s/CS2040` in the command box and presses `Enter` to execute the command. The following
graph specifies how you can input the command. +

.Typing `quiz` command

.The result of `quit` command
image::quiz/QuitQuizCommandResult.png[600, 600]
// end::quizQuit[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Get statistics
You can get statistics of the questions that you have done in the app.
The statistics functions listed below are used to filter the type of statistics that you want to get.

NOTE: Quiz results stored in the app are not synchronised with the questions.
If a question has been modified by the editq command,
the stored quiz result will still refer to the original question
to minimise inconsistencies in the statistics. This is because a question that has been modified to a large extent
might cause past answers to become irrelevant and distort the statistics.

==== Get statistics for subjects : `stats`
Returns a panel containing a break down of the questions by its results.
You can choose to get the statistics for a difficulty level by adding `d/` or
get the statistics of different subjects by adding `s/`.
Typing any other non-statistics command will close this panel. +
Format: `stats [d/DIFFICULTY] [s/SUBJECT1] [s/SUBJECT2]...`

Example:
Let's say you have answered some questions from CS2103T previously and would like
a ballpark figure to estimate how well you have grasp the basic foundations of the subject.

To get this figure:

. Type `stats d/easy s/cs2103t` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here are the statistics: [easy] [cs2103t]"
. And you can see a pie chart of the number of correctly and incorrectly answered questions.

image::statistics/stats.png[]

==== Get questions with correct/incorrect answers: `question`
Get a panel containing all questions that have been answered correctly/incorrectly by using `-c/-i` respectively.
Either one of `-c` or `-i` must be used. You can also filter by subjects by adding `s/`.
Typing any other non-statistics command will close this panel. +
Format: `question [-c] [-i] [s/SUBJECT1] [s/SUBJECT2]...`

Example:
Now that you have gotten the number of correct to incorrect answers, you want to see what questions
you have done wrong to decide on how you can further improve.

To see the questions:

. Type `question -i s/cs2103t` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here are the incorrect questions for [cs2103t]:"
. You will be able to see a list of all your incorrectly answered questions for CS2103T and
your past answers to it as well as a break down of the number of questions by difficulty level.

image::statistics/question.png[]

==== Get a report for individual questions: `report`
Returns a panel containing a report of how well you have answered a particular question
and shows all your past answers to the question.
Typing any other non-statistics command will close this panel. +
Format: `report INDEX`

Example:
After getting the questions that you have done wrong, you noticed that there is one particular
question that you have answered wrong numerous times. This just so happened to be the third
question in the question list. You decided to investigate further.

To see a report of the question:

. Type `report 7` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here is a report of question 7:"
. And you can see all your attempts at the question as well as a pie chart of your results.

image::statistics/report.png[]

==== Get overview of questions attempted: `overview`
Get an overview of the types of questions that have been attempted overall.
A panel containing a stacked bar graph, sorted by subjects will be returned.
You can also add two `dt/` fields representing a time period to get questions you did
within that time period. The format for date is dd/MM/yyyy. Typing any other non-statistics
command will close this panel. +
Format: `overview [dt/START_DATE dt/END_DATE]`

NOTE: For `DATE` input constraints, you may refer to <<Add a revision task for a note: `rn`>>.

NOTE: If you have more than 8 different difficulty levels, the stack bar chart may repeat
colors for the difficulties. To differentiate between the different bars in the chart,
you can use your mouse to hover above them.

Example:
You are finally done viewing your quiz results and want to know what questions you should attempt next.
To be a well-rounded individual, you decided to check if you have been neglecting any subjects recently.

To see an overview of your results:

. Type `overview dt/20/10/2019 dt/05/11/2019` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here is an overview of the questions: (20/10/2019 to 05/11/2019)"
. And you can see a stack bar chart of all questions that you have attempted from 20/10/2019 to 05/11/2019.

image::statistics/overview.png[]
// end::statistics[]

=== Revision tasks

This section provides instructions to manipulate revision tasks. The revision tasks help you plan your revision of notes
and questions.

The diagram below shows how a revision task looks like:

image::UserGuideRes/TaskUI.png[]

NOTE: The revision tasks are not synchronised with the note and the question. Once created, the task content will not
change if you modify the corresponding note or question. For example, if you have added a task for note "An AVL Tree"
and then you delete the note or change the title of the note, the task still exist with the heading unchanged. We adopt
this approach because we would like to allow you to customise the task headings in *version v2.0* of the app. Therefore,
we disassociate the task from notes and questions once created.

NOTE: Revision tasks with the same heading, same date and same time are considered duplicate tasks and cannot co-exist
in the revision task list. Even if they have different status, they still cannot co-exist
because it does not make sense to have same tasks but different status.

==== Add a revision task for a note: `rn`
You can add a revision task for a note to the current revision task list with this command.
The heading will copy the title and the GUI will display all tasks upon completing the command.
An invalid date will be interpreted as the nearest valid date. +
Format: `rn t/TITLE_OF_NOTE dt/START_DATE tm/START_TIME` +

NOTE: `TITLE_OF_NOTE` is case sensitive.

Example: +

1. Type `rn t/CS2103T UML diagram dt/01/11/2019 tm/0900` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/AddTaskForNote_command.png[]
+
2. The result box will display the message "Revision task added: [N] NOTE : CS2103T UML diagram by: 01 November 2019 09:00".
The task is added to the task list shown in the middle panel.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/AddTaskForNote_success.png[]
+

====

*Constrains for `DATE` (yyyy : `YEAR`, MM : `MONTH`, dd : `DAY`), `TIME` (HH : `HOUR` , mm : `MINUTE`) input:*

* All numerical inputs must be integers.
* `DATE` input format should follow Singapore local date convention (i.e. dd/MM/yyyy).
* `YEAR` is 4-digit. 0000 < yyyy < 9999.
* `MONTH` is 2-digit. 00 < MM < 13.
* `DATE` is 2-digit. 00 < dd < 32.
* `HOUR` is 2-digit and follows 24-hour format. -01 < HH < 24.
* `MINUTE` is 2-digit. -01 < mm < 60.

NOTE: There are some days of month which are valid for some months but invalid for others, eg. *31* is invalid for February, April,
June, September, November; *30* is invalid for February; *29* is invalid for February in common years. But they are valid
for other scenarios. Sometimes you may get confused about the number of days in a month. For example, you may happen to think
that there are 31 days in September and you key in "31/09/2019". In this case, the day of month will automatically run
down to the last valid day of that month.

NOTE: "2400" and "0000" for `TIME` are both considered valid and represent 12am on the same day.

====

==== Add a revision task for a question: `rq`
You can add a revision task for a question to the current revision task list with this command. +
The heading will copy the question body. +
The GUI will display all tasks upon completing the command. +
Format: `rq i/INDEX_OF_QUESTION dt/START_DATE tm/START_TIME` +
Example: +
`rq i/1 dt/11/11/2019 tm/1500`

NOTE: For constraints on `DATE` and `TIME` input, you may refer to <<Add a revision task for a note: `rn`>>.

==== Remove revision task: `rdelete`
You can remove a particular revision task from current list with this command. +
The GUI will display the current list (all-task, done-task, not-done-task or overdue-task) view. +
Format: `rdelete INDEX_OF_TASK` +
Example: +

1. Type `rdelete 2` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DeleteTaskCommand.png[]
+
2. The result box will display the message "Deleted task: ..." with the task details. The deleted task will be removed from the task list.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DeleteTaskCommand_success.png[]
+

==== Mark the revision task as done: `rdone`
You can mark a task as done once you finished it.
The GUI will display the current list (all-task, done-task, not-done-task or overdue-task) view. +
Format: `rdone INDEX` +

Example: +

1. Type `rdone 1` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DoneTaskCommand.png[]
+
2. The result box will display the message "Revision task marked as done: [Y] ..." with the task details. The status icon
of the task turns from "[N]" (not done) to "[Y]" (done).
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DoneTaskCommand_success.png[]
+

NOTE: You cannot use "undone" (marking a task as not done) feature as we believe that the chance of accidentally marking
an unfinished task as done is fairly low by command line input. So the app should not support a "undo" action for `rdone`.
People usually "undone" a task because they realise that some parts of the task are not fully completed. In this case, you
should create a new task with a new date or time (same as "re-scheduling" in the real world).

==== Edit a revision task: `redit`
You can edit a revision task with this command. You need to provide non-empty arguments with prefix `h/`, `dt/` and `tm/`
as you would do with `rn`, but only those fields you want to change. + Please take note that *at least one field* must be provided. +
Format: `redit INDEX [h/HEADING] [dt/DATE] [tm/TIME]` +
Example: +
`redit 1 h/CS2100 Logic Circuit dt/15/08/2019 tm/1200`

NOTE: Please note that the prefix for the heading of a task is no longer `t/` (for note task) or `i/` (for question task).
Instead, the prefix becomes `h/` for both types of tasks. `HEADING` can be the title of a note or the question body of a question.
The edited `HEADING` must be an existing title or question body. + `HEADING` is case sensitive.

NOTE: You cannot edit the status (done or not done) of a task with this command. Instead, you may want to use `rdone` if you want to mark a
task as done. You cannot do "undone" operation as explained in `rdone` feature.

==== View all revision tasks: `rlist`
This command displays the whole revision task list. +
Format: `rlist`

==== View completed revision tasks: `finished`
This command displays the list of revision tasks that you have completed. +
Format: `finished`

==== View uncompleted revision task: `unfinished`
This command displays the list of revision tasks that you have not completed. +
Format: `unfinished`

==== View overdue revision tasks: `overdue`
This command displays the revision tasks which you have not done but having passed the start time. +
Format: `overdue`

==== Find tasks with specified details: `rfind`
You may use this command to search for tasks with specified details. You may key in keyword(s) of the heading, or the date, or the time,
with prefix `h/` `dt/` `tm/` respectively.
The GUI will display a task list of all tasks with field (heading or date or time) that matches your input. +
Format:
`rfind h/WORD [WORD]...` or `rfind dt/DATE` or `rfind tm/TIME`

NOTE: Words for headings are case insensitive for `rfind`.

Example: +
`rfind h/hello world` - This command gives you all tasks with headings containing "hello" or "world" or "hello world". +
`rfind dt/01/11/2019` - This command gives you all tasks on 1 November 2019. +
`rfind tm/1200` - This command gives you all tasks at 12:00 (12pm), regardless of date.

NOTE: The priority of the fields are `h/` > `dt/` > `tm/`. When multiple prefixes (fields) are provided for search, only
the field with the highest priority will be considered. The rest will be ignored.

NOTE: When searching according to keywords in the heading, NUStudy will return tasks with headings containing any one of
the words (*not characters*). For example, if you search by "hello world", tasks whose headings contain "hello", "world", "hello world", "world hello",
or "hello world blablabla..." will all appear in the GUI. Our rationale is to provide you with as many matching tasks as
possible in case you cannot remember every word of the headings. Please note that the minimum matching unit is a word in
the heading. For instance, if you key in "he" or "word" while the full task list has tasks with headings "hello", "hello world",
no task will be retrieved because "he" and "word" are not complete words contained in the headings.

//[width="70%",cols="50%,<50%",options="header",]
//|=======================================================================
//|Input|Task shown
//
//|rfind h/hello|"hello" +
//"hello world"
//
//
//|=======================================================================
