== Introduction

NUStudy is an application for managing two kinds of informational material:
lecture notes and flash cards. Their primary purpose is preparing for exams
and tests in universities, but they can also be useful for refreshing memory,
particularly after a module has ended (the reliance of some computing modules
on prior knowledge is rather heavy).

Most of the work is done through a command line; the GUI merely displays
the results. The overall appearance is similar to a simple note-taking client.

== Quickstart

.  Ensure you have Java 11+ installed.
.  Download the latest `nustudy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list`: lists all contacts
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* `delete 3`: deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* `exit`: exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Lecture notes

==== Adding lecture notes: `addnote`
Adds a lecture note. The `i/` field, if provided, brings up a dialogue where an image can be chosen from
the file system; such an image will be displayed beside the note. +
Format: `addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]`

==== Editing lecture notes: `editnote`
Edits an existing lecture note. Providing `i/` brings up the image selection dialogue, like `addnote`;
this can be used to change the image. At least one of `t/`, `c/` and `i/` must be provided.

The index must be between 1 and the number of notes and flashcards combined, inclusive. +
Format: `editnote INDEX [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [i/]`

==== Viewing lecture notes: `shownote`
If an index is provided, a number prefixed with a # (e.g. #1), show the lecture note with that index.
Otherwise, search for lecture notes whose title contains every given word (space-separated, ignoring case),
and display them. +
Format: `shownote [#INDEX | WORDS]`

==== Deleting lecture notes: `deletenote`
Delete the lecture note with the given index, which follows the same restrictions as with `editnote`. +
Format: `deletenote INDEX`

==== Exporting all entries: `export`
Export all items in NUStudy, both flash cards and lecture notes, into a file with the given name. +
Format: `export FILENAME`

==== Importing all entries: `import`
Import all items in the given file into NUStudy. This overwrites any items already in the app. +
Format: `import FILENAME`

NUStudy can also store different sets of questions and answers;
at your command, the system will prompt you to answer those questions.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with
the file that contains the data of your previous folder.
