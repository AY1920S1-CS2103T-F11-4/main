== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The architecture diagram below gives an overall view of NUStudy's structure. Each component
will be explained in more detail in the coming sections.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for initializing and shutting down the application, linking and cleaning up where necessary.

The `commons` package contains classes used by multiple other components, of which `LogsCenter` is important
as it is used for logging. The rest of NUStudy consists of four primary components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of NUStudy.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds application data in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to disk.

Each of the four components defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component
and exposes the API using a `{Component Name}Manager` class. For example, the `Logic` component
(see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Inter-component interaction

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `deletenote 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command

[[Design-Ui]]
=== `UI`

.Class diagram of the `UI` component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`NoteListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract
`UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

This component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== `Logic`

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Class diagram of the `Logic` component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AppDataParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker × but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== `Model`

.Class diagram of the `Model` component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component is independent of the other three primary components of NUStudy.
It stores application data – notes, questions and revision tasks – as well as a `UserPrefs` object
representing the user's preferences. It also exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Note>` that is bound to the UI,
so any data changes are immediately user-visible.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== `Storage`

.Class diagram of the `Storage` component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component reads and writes `UserPrefs` objects and NUStudy data in JSON format.

== Implementation

This section describes some finer details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::lecimage[]
=== Image support for lecture notes
==== Implementation

(Implementation of image support for lecture notes)

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

==== Design considerations: where to place the image?

* _Alternative 1:_ Images are shown within each lecture note in the first column, and each lecture note
shows all of its title, content and image
** Pros: Easier to implement (FXML does not have to reach into other places)
** Cons: Scrolling through lecture notes, all with images, takes time
* _Alternative 2:_ Place the images in the second column, below their corresponding title and content.
** Pros: More visually appealing, and by keeping just one note in the second column it becomes a
kind of flash card
** Cons: Harder to implement (FXML must reach into the object representing the second column)
// end::lecimage[]

=== Question management feature
==== Current Implementation

The question management feature is facilitated by `Model`.
The question-related commands extend `Command` with the question object if necessary.
The commands update the `Model` which is implemented by `ModelManager`.
This in turn updates `AppData` which stores all the questions internally as `UniqueQuestionList`.
Local data will be updated in the end by `LogicManager`.
The commands include:

* `AddQuestionCommand` -- Adds a new question to the app.
* `DeleteQuestionCommand` -- Deletes an existing question in the app.
* `ListQuestionCommand` -- Views the list of all questions available.
* `EditQuestionCommand` -- Edits an existing question in the app. (to be implemented)
* `FindQuestionCommand` -- Finds a question with a specified keyword. (to be implemented)

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addQuestion(Question question)`,
`Model#deleteQuestion(Question question)`, `Model#getFilteredQuestionList()` and
`Model#setQuestion(Question target, Question editedQuestion)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the question mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The app will load all existing information from storage.

Step 2. The user executes `addq q/QUESTION a/ANSWER s/SUBJECT d/DIFFICULTY` command to add a new question to the app.
The `addq` command calls `Model#addQuestion(Question question)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the new question.

Step 3. The user executes `deleteq 5` command to delete the 5th question in the app. The `deleteq` command calls `Model#deleteQuestion(Question target)`
and `Model#updateFilteredQuestionList(Predicate<Question> predicate)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the
target question removed.

Step 4. The user executes `editq 2 a/NEW_ANSWER` command to edit the answer of the 2nd question in the app.
The `editq` command calls `Model#setQuestion(Question target, Question editedQuestion)` and
`Model#updateFilteredQuestionList(Predicate<Question> predicate)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the original
question being replaced by the edited question.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addq` operation works:

image::AddQuestionSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::AddQuestionActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How addq/deleteq/editq commmands execute
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update the internal storage `UniqueQuestionList` in `AppData` first, then save the updated appData
in local storage when the command finishes executing.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Need the extra step to ensure that the internal list is correctly maintained.
* **Alternative 2:** Update the local storage directly when the command is executing.
** Pros: No need to implement the internal list.
** Cons: Will access local memory more frequently. May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the question commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `UniqueQuestionList` to store questions in `AppData`.
** Pros: Cater to the question model specifically. Question list operations are encapsulated in one class.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated as other models also implement similar list structure.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Java list to store the questions.
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate list class.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as the model needs to maintain various
list operations.

=== Add revision task
==== Implementation
`AddTaskForNoteCommand` is implemented to add a task for lecture notes revision. It extends `Command` class and adds a
`Task` for lecture notes revision to the `TaskList` kept in `AppData` model, which wraps all application data.

The `TaskList` is essentially a list of `Task`. `TaskList` supports the `add(Task)` operation and this operation is
exposed to `AppData#addTask(Task)`.

The  `TaskList` class supports

=== Logging

We use `java.util.logging` for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (see <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`,
which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Log messages are written to the console and to a `.log` file.

*Logging levels*

* `SEVERE`: Indicates a critical (potentially fatal) problem with NUStudy.
* `WARNING`: After this incident NUStudy may continue, but with caution.
* `INFO`: Informational reports about actions taken by NUStudy.
* `FINE`: Strictly only useful for debugging purposes, records all data processed by NUStudy.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

The user preferences file location and logging level can be set through the configuration file,
by default `config.json`.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
