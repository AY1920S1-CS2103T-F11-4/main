== Introduction

My team of 5 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
Addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a learning management
application called NUStudy which is targeted to university students. This enhanced applications allows students to
easily manage their lecture notes, test questions and revision tasks; and take a mock quiz as revision if they need.

This is what our project looks like:

This portfolio showcases my contributions to the development of NUStudy. My role was to design and write codes for
the `quiz` features. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more details, as well as the relevant
documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

In this portfolio, a grey highlight `term` indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line
and executed by the application and _italics_ implies a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.
The pull requests and issues are represented by a # and its number (e.g. [#1])

== Summary of contributions

This sections shows a brief summary of my contributions to NUStudy, including coding, documentation and other relevant
helpful contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added:* I added the quiz feature of the application (Starting from
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/36[#36])

* What it does: The `quiz` command allows the users to enter the quiz mode of the application. Users can type answer
on command line and the correctness will be checked to display the result. The result of each quiz will be stored and
used to supports the report feature.

* Justification: In the event that users want to choose a set of questions from the application, the `quiz` command
will randomly select questions from the storage according to the difficulty and subject specified by users. It will
act like an actual online quiz which the question will be displayed one at a time and users need to type answer to
receive the feedback from the application to know whether it is correct or wrong.

* Highlights: This enhancement works with commands implemented with my teammates. The result of each question from a
quiz will be store and my teammate will use it for another feature. The implementation was challenging on how to
override the question panel and displaying quiz questions one after another. I solve it by using a boolean to set the
_QuestionListPanel_ in the _MainWindow_ class and adding a list containing one quiz question in _QuizQuestionList_
class (https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/49[#49]
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/70[#70]
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/76[#76]).

*Other contributions:*

* Basic design of Question feature:

** During the development of quiz feature, I helped to design a basic model of question feature so that my teammate
could refer to the template for modification and further development (https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/39[#39]).

== User guide contributions

We had to update the original addressbook User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added. The
following is an excerpt from our *NUStudy User Guide*, showing additions that I have made for the quiz features.
