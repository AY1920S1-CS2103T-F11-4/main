== Introduction

This project portfolio serves the purpose to showcase my contribution to NUStudy as our software engineering project
and the various skills I have acquired and utilised in the process of development.

=== Project Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[address book application] for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to morph it into a revision flashcard desktop application called *NUStudy*.
This enhanced application enables NUS students to store and manage lecture notes,
practice questions under exam conditions and plan revision tasks effectively.

This is what our project looks like: (todo: graphical user interface)

My role is to design and write the code for question management features. The following sections illustrate
these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to these enhancements.

In this portfolio `monospace` indicates command-line input (commands, parameters, etc.)
and _italics_ mark class names.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

=== Enhancement added:
==== What it does
* I was responsible for **implementing question management features**. A question includes a question body, an answer,
a subject and a difficulty level. I have modified the existing _Person_ model to _Question_ model, as well as
some of its relevant fields in the original address book application.

* The question management commands are modified by the original person management commands as well.
The commands include: _AddQuestionCommand_, _EditQuestionCommand_, _DeleteQuestionCommand_, _ClearQuestionCommand_,
_FindQuestionCommand_, _FindDifficultyCommand_, _FindSubjectCommand_, _ListQuestionCommand_.

==== Justification
It is important for students to constantly practice questions to test their understanding as well as get familiarize
with the concepts they have learned. This question management system allows students to store questions easily.
They are able to use this app as a question bank for them to revise. Furthermore, by defining difficulty levels for
each question, student can have a better sense of how well they have learned from this topic or this subject in general.
The question bank can also support other features such as quiz mode and various statistics for attempts.

=== Other contributions

* Testing: As I am responsible for testing, I have added a significant number of test classes which increased
coverage to a large extent.

* Documentation: I modified the user guide from a draft version to the standardised formal version. I have also
standardised the command format for most of the features.

* Community:
** Reviewed Pull Requests
** Reported bugs and offered suggestions for other teams in the class

== User guide contributions

We had to update the original addressbook User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added.
The following is an excerpt from our NUStudy User Guide, showing additions that I have made for the
question management features.
