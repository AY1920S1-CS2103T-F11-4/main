== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis] to perform _continuous integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> for more details.

== Documentation previews

When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a jar file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example,
this project depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library]
for JSON parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated using Gradle.
